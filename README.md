## Introduction
The **'libft'** project is aimed at developing a library of fundamental C functions, including those from the standard library (libc). These functions are written from scratch to understand their underlying mechanisms and improve programming skills in C.

## Usage
To use the **'libft'** library in your projects, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository
2. Compile the library:
```make all```

## Functions
The **'libft'** library includes various categories of functions, such as:

* Memory manipulation functions (e.g., **`ft_memset`**, **`ft_memcpy`**, **`ft_memmove`**)
* String manipulation functions (e.g., **`ft_strlen`**, **`ft_strcpy`**, **`ft_strcat`**)
* Linked list functions (e.g., **`ft_lstnew`**, **`ft_lstadd_front`**, **`ft_lstsize`**)
* Character classification functions (e.g., **`isalpha`**, **`isdigit`**, **`isprint`**)
* And many more!
